# Configuring for the IDE

## Visual Studio Code

In order to configure analyzers for VSCode, you will need to update your project's `.vscode/settings.json` file or your user settings. You should only need the following settings:

```json
{
  "FSharp.enableAnalyzers": true,
  "FSharp.analyzersPath": ["packages/analyzers"]
}
```

ðŸ““ Note: The path in `FSharp.analyzersPath` above is currently pointing to the path we set up in the Paket example on the [installation page]({{fsdocs-previous-page-link}}).

After saving your new settings, make sure to restart VSCode. Once VSCode restarts, you should be able to test and see if the analyzers are working by opening a F# file in your workspace and entering the following code
