# Getting started using analyzers

## Premise

We assume the analyzers you want to use are distributed as a nuget package.

## Using analyzers in a single project

### Raw command line

A dotnet CLI tool, called [fsharp-analyzers](https://www.nuget.org/packages/fsharp-analyzers), is used to run analyzers outside the context of an IDE.  
Add it to your tool-manifest with:
```shell
dotnet tool install fsharp-analyzers
```

Next, add the `PackageReference` pointing to your favorite analyzers to the `.fsproj` file of the project you want to analyze:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="G-Research.FSharp.Analyzers" Version="0.3.0">
    <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
    <IncludeAssets>build</IncludeAssets>
</PackageReference>
```

At the time of writing, the [G-Research analyzers](https://github.com/g-research/fsharp-analyzers) [package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/G-Research.FSharp.Analyzers) contains the only analyzers compatible with the latest CLI tool.  
With the package downloaded, we can run the CLI tool:

```shell
dotnet fsharp-analyzers --project ./YourProject.fsproj --analyzers-path C:\Users\yourusername\.nuget\packages\g-research.fsharp.analyzers\0.3.0\analyzers\dotnet\fs\ --verbose
```

### Using an MSBuild target

As you can see, the path to the analyzer DLL files could be tricky to get right across a wide range of setups.  
Luckily, we can use an MSBuild custom target to take care of the path construction.  

Add [FSharp.Analyzers.Build](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Analyzers.Build) to your `fsproj`:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="FSharp.Analyzers.Build" Version="0.1.0" PrivateAssets="all" />
```

This imports two targets to your project file: `AnalyzeFSharpProject` and `AnalyzeFSharpProjectUsingFscArgs`.  
These will allow us to easily run the analyzers for our project.  

Before we can run `dotnet msbuild /t:AnalyzeFSharpProject`, we need to add specify our settings in a property called `FSharpAnalyzersOtherFlags`:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <FSharpAnalyzersOtherFlags>--analyzers-path &quot;$(PkgG-Research_FSharp_Analyzers)/analyzers/dotnet/fs&quot; --report &quot;$(MSBuildProjectName)-$(TargetFramework).sarif&quot; --treat-as-warning IONIDE-004 --verbose</FSharpAnalyzersOtherFlags>
</PropertyGroup>
```

To locate the analyzer DLLs in the filesystem, we use the variable `$(PkgG-Research_FSharp_Analyzers)`. It's produced by NuGet and normalized to be usable by [MSBuild](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files#generatepathproperty).
In general, a `Pkg` prefix is added and dots in the package ID are replaced by underscores. But make sure to look at the [nuget.g.props](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/msbuild-targets#restore-outputs) file in the `obj` folder for the exact string.  
The `/analyzers/dotnet/fs` subpath is a convention analyzer authors should follow when creating their packages.

At last, you can run the analyzer from the project folder:

```shell
dotnet msbuild /t:AnalyzeFSharpProject
```

Note: if your project has multiple `TargetFrameworks` the tool will be invoke for each target framework.

### Analyze FSharp project using FscArgs

So ü§î, what is the difference between `AnalyzeFSharpProject` and `AnalyzeFSharpProjectUsingFscArgs`?

The way the analyzers work is that we will programmatically type-check a project and process the results with our analyzers. In order to do this programmatically we need to construct the [FSharpProjectOptions](https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-compiler-docs/reference/fsharp-compiler-codeanalysis-fsharpprojectoptions.html).  
This is essentially a type that represents all the fsharp compiler arguments. When using `--project`, we will use [ProjInfo](https://github.com/ionide/proj-info) to invoke a set of MSBuild targets in the project to perform a design-time build.  
A design-time build is basically an empty invocation of a build. It won't produce assemblies but will have constructed the correct arguments to theoretically invoke the compiler.  

There's an alternative way to do this. Instead of using the `--project` argument, it's possible to use the `--fsc-args` argument to let the CLI tool construct the needed `FSharpProjectOptions`.  
The `AnalyzeFSharpProjectUsingFscArgs` uses MSBuild to construct the raw `fsc` arguments. This potentially be faster (due to MSBuild caching) and more accurate.

## Using analyzers in a solution

Adding the custom target from above to all `.fsproj` files of a solution doesn't scale very well.  
So we use the MSBuild infrastructure to add the needed package reference and the MSBuild target to all projects in one go.  

We start with adding the `PackageReference` pointing to your favorite analyzers to the [Directory.Build.props](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/customize-by-directory?view=vs-2022) file.  
This adds the package reference to all `.fsproj` files that are in a subfolder of the file location of `Directory.Build.props`:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="FSharp.Analyzers.Build" Version="0.1.0" PrivateAssets="all" />
    <PackageReference Include="G-Research.FSharp.Analyzers" Version="0.1.6">
        <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
        <IncludeAssets>build</IncludeAssets>
    </PackageReference>
</ItemGroup>
```

Likewise we add the `FSharpAnalyzersOtherFlags` property to the [Directory.Build.targets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/customize-by-directory?view=vs-2022) file.  
This is effectively the same as adding a property to each `*proj` file which exists in a subfolder.
```xml
<Project>
    <PropertyGroup>
        <SarifOutput Condition="$(SarifOutput) == ''">./</SarifOutput>
        <CodeRoot Condition="$(CodeRoot) == ''">.</CodeRoot>
        <FSharpAnalyzersOtherFlags>--analyzers-path &quot;$(PkgG-Research_FSharp_Analyzers)/analyzers/dotnet/fs&quot; --report &quot;$(SarifOutput)$(MSBuildProjectName)-$(TargetFramework).sarif&quot; --code-root $(CodeRoot) --treat-as-warning IONIDE-004 --verbose</FSharpAnalyzersOtherFlags>
    </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

‚ö†Ô∏è We are adding the `FSharpAnalyzersOtherFlags` property to our **Directory.Build.targets** and **not to** any **Directory.Build.props** file!  
MSBuild will first evaluate `Directory.Build.props` which has no access to the generated nuget.g.props. `$(PkgIonide_Analyzers)` won't be known at this point. `Directory.Build.targets` is evaluated after the project file and has access to `Pkg` generated properties.

As we don't want to list all projects of the solution explicitly when analyzing the solution, we create a second custom MSBuild target that calls the project-specific target for all projects.  
Add the following custom target to the [Directory.Solution.targets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/customize-solution-build?view=vs-2022) file to be able to invoke analysis of the whole solution in one simple command:

```xml
<Project>
    <ItemGroup>
        <ProjectsToAnalyze Include="src/**/*.fsproj" />
    </ItemGroup>

    <Target Name="AnalyzeSolution">
        <!-- 
        If you use `AnalyzeFSharpProjectUsingFscArgs`, it is recommended to build the solution upfront.
        You can use the `Exec` tag to achieve this.
        <Exec Command="dotnet build -c Release $(SolutionFileName)" />
        -->
        <MSBuild Projects="@(ProjectsToAnalyze)" Targets="AnalyzeFSharpProject" />
    </Target>
</Project>
```

At last, you can run the analyzer from the solution folder:

```shell
dotnet msbuild /t:AnalyzeSolution
```

Note: we passed the `--code-root` flag so that the `*.sarif` report files will report file paths relative to this root. This can be imported for certain editors to function properly.
